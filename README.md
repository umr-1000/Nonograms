# Nonograms

When compiling/building code, use the following command:


g++ nonograms.cpp levels.cpp -lncurses


Make sure the terminals directory is the same as where the build is extracted. This can be done by:

pwd					(displays current directory)

cd "file path to project folder"	(changes the directory of terminal)



These steps are important so the whole code compiles and the code is able to read and edit the settings.txt file.
